    <h1>Vintage Muscle</h1>
    <p>America loves speed. The 1960s and 1970s might have produced the wildest
        and rarest muscle cars packing giant torque-rich V-8s, but the 1980s
        brought its share of powerful machines to the street, tooâ€”cars that were
        quick and met the more stringent emissions controls. And behind the
        horsepower there are some surprising stories.</p>
